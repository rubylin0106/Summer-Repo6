```

# 1)
#a) Use the R function nrow to confirm that the iris data frame has 150 rows. Then use and show R code that features a map function to confirm that the iris data frame has 150 rows.
```{r}
data("iris")
nrow(iris)
irislist <- list(iris)
map(irislist,count)
#map2_dbl(iris)

```

# b) Each column of the iris data frame has a unique number of values or objects. For example, the column Sepal.Length has 150 values but 35 of them are unique. Use and show R code that features a map function to find the number of unique values or objects for each column of the iris data frame.
```{r}
str(iris)
#is.na(iris)
iris[is.na(iris)]
iris_unique <- lapply(iris, unique) 
(iris_unique)#?
map(Sepal.Length, unique)
#colSums(Sepal.Length)
count(irislist)
```

# 2) Use and show R code that features a nested loop that will produce the  5 by 3 matrix shown below.


```{r}
z <- matrix( nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
for (m in 1:3) {
  for (n in 1:5) {
    z[m, n] <- 2-(m+2-n)
  }
}
print(z)
```
# 3)Use and show R code that will produce a tibble that features 10 randomly generated values that are normally distributed, with means of -10, 0, 10 and 100 respectfully.  Run your code again, producing a second tibble, that confirms random values, hence the second table will no
```{r}
rnorm(10)
tribble(~ mean
        -10,0,100)->parameters
parameters
```

```{r}
tribble( ~mean, ~sd,  ~n,
        5,       1,   15,
        
        10,      5,   10,
        -3,      10,  20
        ) -> parameters
parameters
```

# 4)
```{r}
X <- list(12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22,10,18,18)
Mean <- list(16, 16, 16, 16, 16,16,16,16,16)
sd <- list(2, 2, 2, 2, 2,2,2,2,2)
```
# a) In statistics, a z score indicates the standard deviation distance between the mean and a specific value of the data set. What formula is used to find a z score? Use and show R coding that features a map function to iteratively find z scores across the lists  given above.

# b) The test statistic for a population mean is given by the formula ((X - mean)/s/sqrt(n)) Use and show R coding that features a map function to iteratively find test statistics for population means across the lists given above 

# 5)
```{r}
V = c(10,15,17,22,32,38,42)
```
# a) Another purr package function is the keep( ) function. Research, explore, and use the keep( ) function to extract all number from the vector V given above that are less than 20 

# b) Another purr package function is the discard( ) function. Research, explore, and use the discard( ) function to eliminate all numbers from the vector V given above that are less than 20 

# 6) Another purr package function is the safely( ) function. Research, explore, and apply the safely( ) function  to the given vector below as illstrated In four or five sentences, explain the specific output for this problem and how the definition and the application of the safely( ) function is used.
````{r}
  U = list(10,15,"mary",22,32,"james",42)
  map(U, safely(~ .x+15))
