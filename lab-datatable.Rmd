```{r,include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
```

# 1) Use and show data.table code to select the variables year, month, day, and hour from the imported flights data
```{r}
flights1 <- fread("nycdata.csv")  
flights1
flights2 <- read_csv("nycdata.csv")  
flights2
```

```{r}
flights1[order(year,month,day,hour)]
```

# 2) Use and show data. table code to produce a table that shows a carrier of DL, an origin of JFK and a destination of SEA
```{r}
flights1[carrier == "DL" & origin == "JFK" & dest == "SEA"]
```

# 3) Use and show data.table code to produce a table that shows a carrier of UA, a month of March, and an airtime that is below 330.
```{r}
flights1[carrier == "UA" & month == "3" & air_time < "330"]
```

# 4) Use and show tidyverse code to produce a table that shows a carrier of UA, a month of March, and an airtime that is below 330.  
```{r}
flights2 %>%
  select(carrier,month,air_time)%>%
  filter(carrier == "UA", month == "3",air_time < "330") ->ua330
ua330
```

# 5) Use the data.table method to add a variable called speed that is the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour. 
```{r}
flights1[, c("speed") := .(distance/(air_time/60))] -> speed
speed

```

# 6) Use the tidyverse method to add a variable called speed that is the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour.
```{r}
flights2 %>%
  mutate(speed = distance/(air_time/60)) -> mph
mph
```

# 7) Show and use coding to change the carrier abbreviation of UA to UniitedAir 
## 7a) data.table method
```{r}
flights1[carrier == "UA", carrier := "UniitedAir"] 
flights1
```

## 7b tidyverse method  (Use a sequence of dplyr commands so that you can see the change in your table)
```{r}
flights2 %>%
  mutate(carrier = recode(carrier, "UA" = "UniitedAir")) %>%
   filter(carrier=="UniitedAir")
```
